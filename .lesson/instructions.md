# OOP Project - RPG Combat Game

## Brief

Your goal is open ended to create a RPG Game that uses OOP in the code as well as other programming techniques you have used this year (such as using sub-routines, records, abstract data types).
Beyond this you have free reign to add whatever features you feel necessary to the game, use this as a chance to push your programming and explore new ideas.

The project will be done in groups of 2 (or 3) and you will be presenting your work at the start of year 13.
There is an expectation that you will be working on this during the break.

## Ideas on how to best use OOP

- Create a base class for all characters in the game that includes useful data such as hp, name. Then inherit and extend this to create player characters with inventory space and xp or enemies that have a loot drop or require mp.
- Define methods beyond simple getters and setters to provide useful functionality. For example a subtractHealth() function that automatically updates a character's health total rather than using setters and getters in the main code.
- Make sure methods are defined at the appropriate level to avoid duplication of code, you can always refactor the code if needed to make it neater.
- Use OOP alongside decomposition to allow each member of the team to independently program before combining the work together.

## Other programming tips
- Used paired programming to help work through the trickiest parts of the code
- Write modular code to help with the organisation of the project.
- Use an ADT to help organise the data
  - Circular Queue of characters to manage turn order
  - Records to store a collection of enemies together to form an encouter of several foes.
- Use what you have learnt from the SDLC to help inform your engineering approach - you don't need to follow a specific model but do keep in mind common areas such as planning and testing.
- Organise your code into seperate Python files if needed and use imports to gain access to them.

## Presentation

- The presentation will be the work you submit and a chance for you to show off your hard work and explain how you approached the programming.
- The following elements will be a useful way to show your peers how you structured your code with out showing all 1000 lines:
- Structure chart
- Class Inheritence Diagram
- Flowcharts and/or pseudocode for key algorithms

- Video or screenshots of the game being played will also be interesting to show the concepts in motion.
